# psy8712-final
The current project consisted of the final project material for PSY8712 class.

## Dataset Introduction
In the current project, I perform analysis based on a [pre-collected GRE dataset](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/155721/version/V1/view;jsessionid=CCA87775E2BAE63EE1B4FC92FF3AE409>). The dataset contains demographic information (sex, age, major), GRE scores (GRE Verbal, Quant, and Writing), and other related outcomes (First Year GPA, etc.). 

## Project Reproduce
To reproduce the current R project, one first download the "GRE IVY.sav" file from the above link and put it in the "data" folder.
